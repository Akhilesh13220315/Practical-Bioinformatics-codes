# Practical-Bioinformatics-codes
Practical-Bioinformatics-codesThis repository serves as a practical collection of Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks (specifically designed for Google Colab) demonstrating fundamental bioinformatics concepts and analyses. It's intended for students, researchers, or anyone looking to get hands-on experience with bioinformatics programming, particularly using the powerful Biopython library.What's Inside?This repository currently features code for various essential bioinformatics tasks, directly interacting with open-source biological databases:Sequence Fetching from Public Databases:Scripts to programmatically retrieve DNA, RNA, or protein sequences from major public databases like NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) using accession IDs.Relevant file(s): sequence_analysis_from_ncbi.ipynb (or similar Python script)Basic Sequence Analysis:Functions to perform fundamental analyses on fetched sequences, including:Calculating sequence length.Determining GC content.Transcribing DNA to RNA.Translating RNA to protein.Relevant file(s): sequence_analysis_from_ncbi.ipynbPairwise Sequence Alignment:Demonstrates how to perform both global alignment (Needleman-Wunsch) and local alignment (Smith-Waterman) between two sequences fetched from NCBI.This helps in identifying regions of similarity and inferring evolutionary or functional relationships between sequences.Relevant file(s): sequence_analysis_from_ncbi.ipynbConceptual Explanation of Genome Comparison:While full-scale genome-to-genome alignment is computationally intensive for a simple script, the repository includes a detailed explanation of the concepts, specialized tools, and approaches used for large-scale genome comparisons in bioinformatics.Relevant file(s): sequence_analysis_from_ncbi.ipynb (as a markdown section within the notebook/script)Image Visualization Utility (Google Colab):A utility script to fetch and display images directly within a Google Colab environment from a given URL. Useful for visualizing biological diagrams or results.Relevant file(s): image_viewer_colab.ipynb (or similar Python script)Technologies UsedPython: The primary programming language for all scripts.Biopython: A widely used open-source Python library for bioinformatics, providing tools for sequence manipulation, database access, alignment, and more.Requests: For making HTTP requests (e.g., fetching images).PIL (Pillow): For image processing.Matplotlib: For basic plotting and image display.How to Use This RepositoryThese codes are designed to be easily runnable, especially within a Google Colab environment.PrerequisitesPython 3.xBiopython library: You can install it using pip:pip install biopython requests Pillow matplotlib
Google Colab (Recommended): Most scripts are optimized for execution in Google Colab notebooks.Getting StartedClone the repository:git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Practical-Bioinformatics-codes.git
cd Practical-Bioinformatics-codes
(Remember to replace YourGitHubUsername with your actual GitHub username.)Open in Google Colab:Navigate to your cloned repository on GitHub.Click on the .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) files.Click "Open in Colab" at the top of the notebook.Alternatively, in Google Colab, go to File > Open notebook > GitHub and paste the repository URL.Run the cells:Once the notebook is open in Colab, run each code cell sequentially.Important: For scripts interacting with NCBI (e.g., sequence_analysis_from_ncbi.ipynb), remember to replace "your.email@example.com" with your actual email address as required by NCBI's Entrez API.Future PlansExpand with more advanced NGS data analysis examples (e.g., RNA-Seq differential expression, variant annotation workflows).Include examples of working with other bioinformatics tools and libraries.Add more detailed explanations and theoretical backgrounds within the notebooks.ContributingContributions are welcome!
